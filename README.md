![game](https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*dQzFEaAHwxouaImAuUd3EQ.gif)
## ABOUT ##
- I plan on making a minesweeper game 
## CONCEPT OF THE GAME ##
-  a puzzle game which the player will select a cell in a square grid continuously. Each cell hides a bomb or a value which displays the number of bombs in itâ€™s neighboring cells. Just to make it clear, neighboring cells are defined as adjacent horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
## HOW IM GOING TO GET STARTED ##
first thing im going to do is make the cells where the bombs and neighbor numbers will be placed, then im going to add a bomb that is randomly placed for future refference.
then im going to make it so multiple bombs can be inputed and randomized dependind on the size of the grid, then im going to create the actual game functions such as checkWin function and makeMap functions.

## Task

Your task is to build a browser-based game utilizing HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

**Ideas**:
- Blackjack
- Memory Flash Cards
- Connect Four
- Battleship
- Dice Movement Game (Candyland, Sorry, etc.)
- Snake
- Anything Else You Can Think Of

## For Project Approval
- **Your game must be approved by the instructors before you start**
- Detailed README.md (Project Title, Description, How to Get Started, Credits)
- A Trello Board detailing the plan and progress of your project (linked on your ReadMe)

### **Project _Approval_ Due Date:** 7/5/22 by 9:00AM EST


## Project Requirements (MVP)
**Your project must:**
- Be a **new repo**. Create a new repo in your GitHub and build your project there. **DO NOT** name your repository Project 1. Give it a real name.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **README.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)
- Include a minimum of **2 HTML pages** and navigation between them
- Include a minimum of **2 event handlers**
- Have at least **20** _meaningful_ `git` commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments, if in your code at all, should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
- Display proper use of global variables and function parameters (function scopes)
- Use camelCase for JavaScript variables
- Be deployed on [Surge](https://surge.sh/) (We will cover this on Monday of project week)

### **Project _Completed_ Due Date:** 7/8/22 by 1:30PM EST

## Tips

- Research what you consider the best game websites out there to get ideas/inspiration
- Chat and bounce ideas off your classmates and gather useful feedback
- Commit early (day one) and often (everytime you implement a new feature)
- Implement _all project requirements first_ before moving on to post-mvp features
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase - it could land you a job)

## Post-MVP Ideas
- Add a dark mode feature
- Use object oriented programming to create reusable elements
- Use Google Fonts in your project. To do this, find a font on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) , select the font, go to the *embed* link, and put its HTML tag in your HTML document's `<head>` tag, *above* your link to your CSS. You will then need to use its CSS Rule to apply it in your CSS file.

## A Note on Plagiarism
  
- Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for immediate withdrawal.
- You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and Stack Overflow for help. However, it is <b><i>not acceptable to copy</i></b> another persons code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.
- Small snippets of code that solve small problems taken from Stack Overflow are generally an exception to this rule. If you aren't sure, it is your responsibility to <b><i>ask your instructor</i></b>. To be on the safe side, we ask that you credit the person/resource you got the code from in a comment, and let an instructor take a look at it.
