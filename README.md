![game](https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*dQzFEaAHwxouaImAuUd3EQ.gif)


## Task

Your task is to build a browser-based game utilizing HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

**Ideas**:
- Blackjack
- Connect Four
- Battleship
- Dice Movement Game (Candyland, Sorry, etc.)
- Snake
- Anything Else You Can Think Of

## For Project Approval
- **Your game must be approved by the instructors before you start**
- Detailed README.md (Project Title, Description, How to Get Started, Credits)
- A Trello Board detailing the plan and progress of your project (linked on your ReadMe)

**Project _Approval_ Due Date:** 08/09/21 by 10:00am EST


## Project Requirements (MVP)
**Your project must:**
- Be a **new repo**. Create a new repo in your GitHub and build your project there. **DO NOT** name your repository Project 1. Give it a real name.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **README.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)
- Include a minimum of **2 HTML pages** and navigation between them
- Include a minimum of **2 event handlers**
- Have at least **20** _meaningful_ `git` commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments, if in your code at all, should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
- Display proper use of global variables and function parameters (function scopes)
- Use camelCase for JavaScript variables
- Be deployed on [Surge](https://surge.sh/) (We will cover this on Thursday of project week)

**Project _Completed_ Due Date:** 08/13/21 by 2:30pm EST

## Tips

- Research what you consider the best game websites out there to get ideas/inspiration
- Chat and bounce ideas off your classmates and gather useful feedback
- Commit early (day one) and often (everytime you implement a new feature)
- Implement _all project requirements first_ before moving on to post-mvp features
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase - it could land you a job)
- Use Google Fonts in your project. To do this, find a font on https://fonts.google.com/ , select the font, go to the *embed* link, and put its HTML tag in your HTML document's `<head>` tag, *above* your link to your CSS. You will then need to use its CSS Rule to apply it in your CSS file. Example:
- ```html
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Sansita+Swashed:wght@500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
  ```

## Post-MVP Ideas
- Use a public API with your game
- Add a dark mode feature
- Use object oriented programming to create reusable elements

## A Note on Plagiarism
  
- Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for immediate withdrawal.
- You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and Stack Overflow for help. However, it is <b><i>not acceptable to copy</i></b> another persons code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.
- Small snippets of code that solve small problems taken from Stack Overflow are generally an exception to this rule. If you aren't sure, it is your responsibility to <b><i>ask your instructor</i></b>. To be on the safe side, we ask that you credit the person/resource you got the code from in a comment, and let an instructor take a look at it.
